abts-fundamentals,BizTalk 2006 Fundamentals,24305,2008-06-01,"Despite the trend towards service-oriented architectures, most organizations do not have the luxury of moving all of their investments in that direction at once. The fact is most will have to deal with legacy applications for some time to come. And to complicate matters further, typical business processes transcend multiple heterogeneous applications making them difficult to automate. In this course we look at how to use BizTalk Server (BTS) to bridge such integration gaps and simplify business process automation. By combining the connectivity provided by its messaging engine with the productivity provided by its orchestration engine, BizTalk Server can help you tackle tough business process scenarios in your connected systems today.",Live,no
